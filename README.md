Identify phishing characteristics in a suspicious email sample.
# Phishing Email Simulation & Detection Analysis

This repository contains a phishing email simulation project conducted during my internship at **Elevate Labs**. The goal was to design a fake phishing email, analyze its traits, and evaluate detection techniques.

## üìå Project Overview
- **Simulation**: Created a fake Canara Bank email with the subject _"Action Required: Account Verification"_.
- **Objective**: Test phishing detection using manual analysis and tools like **EML Analyzer** and **SpamAssassin**.
- **Format**: Email saved in `.eml` and analyzed for technical indicators.

## üîç Key Findings
- Spoofed sender address and brand impersonation.
- Urgency & fear tactics in subject line.
- Suspicious verification link (Google Form).
- Missing headers & RFC compliance issues.
- SpamAssassin score: **5.50** (high risk).

## üìÇ Contents
- `Phishing Simulation Report.docx` ‚Äì Detailed project report.
- Extracted email headers (text format).
- Simulation email evidence (PDF).

## ‚úÖ Conclusion
The project highlights how **manual inspection + automated tools** are crucial in detecting phishing attempts. It also emphasizes the importance of awareness and technical safeguards for cybersecurity defense.
